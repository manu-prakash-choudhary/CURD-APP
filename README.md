# crud_app_with_ajax_and_django

Hey there, in this repository I have created a curd app where you can make your account create a post, like/Unlike a post, and can delelte your post.
I have used django-framework as backend-server and dbsqlite as database.
In this application I learned how an signal travels and how to handle and enroute it. It is an really good  project to learn all about django-signals
